Hi, I’m Avinash.
I’m a Chemical Engineering graduate from the University of Texas at Austin currently seeking full-time, entry-level chemical engineering roles. I have hands-on experience in process design, optimization, and experimental research within the energy sector. During my undergraduate research, I worked on a project involving nanoparticles to study and improve scale inhibitor adsorption in oil pipelines. Through this work, I contributed to data-driven performance improvements and am currently involved in efforts toward a research publication.

I’m passionate about applying engineering fundamentals, simulation tools, and analytical methods to solve real-world energy and sustainability challenges. I enjoy working with tools like Aspen Plus, MATLAB, Python, and Excel to model systems, analyze data, and design practical engineering solutions.

Beyond the technical side, I value teamwork, leadership, and continuous learning, and I’m excited to grow as an engineer while contributing meaningfully to impactful projects.
Feel free to explore my projects below to learn more about my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate.
