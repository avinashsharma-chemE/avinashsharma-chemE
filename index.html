<p>
    I’m a Chemical Engineering graduate from the University of Texas at Austin currently seeking
    full-time, entry-level chemical engineering roles. I have hands-on experience in process design,
    optimization, and experimental research within the energy sector.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    During my undergraduate research, I worked on a project involving
    <strong>nanoparticles</strong> to study and improve scale inhibitor adsorption in oil pipelines.
    Through this work, I contributed to data-driven performance improvements and am currently involved
    in efforts toward a research publication.
</p>

<h2>What I Enjoy Working On</h2>
<p>
    I’m passionate about applying engineering fundamentals, simulation tools, and analytical methods
    to solve real-world energy and sustainability challenges. I enjoy working with tools like Aspen Plus,
    MATLAB, Python, and Excel to model systems, analyze data, and design practical engineering solutions.
</p>

<h2>How I Work</h2>
<p>
    Beyond the technical side, I value teamwork, leadership, and continuous learning, and I’m excited
    to grow as an engineer while contributing meaningfully to impactful projects.
