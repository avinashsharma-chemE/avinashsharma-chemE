    <h1>Avinash Sharma</h1>

    <p>
        I’m a Chemical Engineering graduate from the University of Texas at Austin currently seeking
        full-time, entry-level chemical engineering roles. I have hands-on experience in process design,
        optimization, and experimental research within the energy sector.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        During my undergraduate research, I worked on a project involving
        <strong>nanoparticles</strong> to study and improve scale inhibitor adsorption in oil pipelines.
        Through this work, I contributed to data-driven performance improvements and am currently involved
        in efforts toward a research publication.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Enjoy Working On</h2>
    <p>
        I’m passionate about applying engineering fundamentals, simulation tools, and analytical methods
        to solve real-world energy and sustainability challenges. I enjoy working with tools like Aspen Plus,
        MATLAB, Python, and Excel to model systems, analyze data, and design practical engineering solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond the technical side, I value teamwork, leadership, and continuous learning, and I’m excited
        to grow as an engineer while contributing meaningfully to impactful projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to explore my projects below to learn more about my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out
        if you’d like to connect or collaborate.
    </p>
